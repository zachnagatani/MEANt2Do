# MEANToDo
MEANToDo is a simple todo app built with the MEAN stack (get it? MEANToDo?... yuh).
## About
MEANToDo is an Angular 1 SPA that connects to an API built with Node, Express, and MongoDB.
I have a background in front-end, so my focus on this app was to gain experience with the other three letters of the MEAN stack.
## Get Started
To run the app:
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/zachnagatani/MEANt2Do.git` to download the files
2. Run `gulp build` to build out the production (minified, concatenated, etc.) code
3. Run `gulp serve:dist` to serve the production code
4. Keep track of what you MEANToDo!
